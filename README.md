# Laravel Single Sign On Demo
This is one way of learning Laravel, that is coding it. Make it works as you want. I want this application to act as central authentication provider. Like you use social login to log user in your application. This application will behave like that authenticate user and notify calling application of the result.

- Provides normal email/password for this application itself, this done by the framework out of the box.
- Mobile (frontend) authentication using token based.
- Acts as single sign on server for other applications, may be made by Laravel itself or others.

# Packages Used
- Laravel Breeze as authentication scaffolding.
- Laravel Passport, the main package here.
